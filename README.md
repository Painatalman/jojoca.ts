# Jojoca.ts

Make no function fail ever again (although that's not a good thing).
A parody project forked from [jojoca.js](https://github.com/jorgealves/jojoca.js), remade with TypeScript and covered by tests.

## Features

Wrap functions in a wrapper that prevents an error from throwing, while still being able to handle it yourself (through a callback).

## Resources

This project was set up based on [this tutorial](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/node-starter-project/)
